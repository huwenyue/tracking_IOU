## This project is about multi-object tracking with IOU method.
Here is the MOT Competition and Benchmark website :

IOU means Intersection over Union, which is a standard used to measure the accuracy of some defined objects. 
In this project, I use IOU to calculate the differences between detected frame and real objects.
